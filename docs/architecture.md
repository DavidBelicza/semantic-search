# Architecture

A Go library for semantic search over a directory of files (Markdown, PDF, code, DOCX, plain
text). Files are discovered, chunked, and embedded through an OpenAI-compatible model server,
then stored either embedded in SQLite or server-side in PostgreSQL. Search embeds the query,
ranks chunks by vector similarity, and returns the matching documents.

## Layers

```
semanticsearch.go    library facade (package semanticsearch): builds the object graph
                     and exposes Index, Search, and the constructors
internal/pipeline    the flow — indexing and the document search
core/search          public search types (SearchConfig, SearchResult, DocumentResult)
                     and the Searcher seam
core/strategy        the per-file contract (Strategy interface) + Pool; concrete
                     strategies live in subpackages:
                       strategy/general   base structured strategy + chunking engine
                       strategy/markdown  Markdown parsing/chunking
                       strategy/pdf       PDF parsing (PDFium) + font-based sections
                       strategy/code      code parsing (Chroma lexer) + definition sections
                       strategy/docx      DOCX parsing (zip + XML) + heading sections
core/storage         resource entities (Document, Chunk, …); no database code
  storage/sqlite     documents + chunks tables — embedded source of truth
  storage/sqlitevec  sqlite-vec vectors — embedded
  storage/postgres   documents + chunks tables — server-side source of truth
  storage/pgvector   pgvector vectors — server-side
internal/textproc    generic, dependency-free text utilities (split, window, tokens,
                     hash, normalize, part packing, heading-path stack)
internal/fs          stable file identity (device + inode)
core/embedder
  client             the embedding transport client (OpenAI-compatible)
  model              the model definitions (id, dimensions, prompt templates; e.g. Gemma)
```

Rule of thumb: `internal/*` and `core/*` provide the parts; the root `semanticsearch` package
assembles them into an `Engine` that callers drive. Dependencies point downward: `textproc` and
`storage` depend on nothing of ours; strategies depend on both; the pipeline depends on the
strategy contract.

## Strategy — the per-file recipe

A `Strategy` owns the complete life of a single file and does no file I/O or directory
walking (the pipeline hands it the bytes). Interface (`core/strategy`):

```
Claims(path) bool
CreateMetadata(FileRef) (FileMetadata, error)
Fingerprint(content) string
Parse(content) (ParsedDocument, error)        // bytes → sections
Chunk(doc, ParsedDocument) ([]Chunk, error)   // sections → chunks
Embed(ctx, chunks) ([][]float32, error)
```

`Parse` produces a `ParsedDocument` — the file's sections, each a heading path plus body.
`Chunk` slices those sections into chunks, so every chunk carries its heading context.

- **`general.GeneralStrategy`** — the base structured strategy: claims plain-text extensions,
  stat→metadata, hash, one section from the whole text, structured chunking (it owns the
  shared `ChunkSections` engine), embed via the injected embedder.
- **`markdown`** — overrides `Claims` (extension), `Parse` (goldmark headings → sections),
  and `Chunk` (fence-aware).
- **`pdf`** — overrides `Claims` and `Parse` (PDFium extracts font-annotated runs; headings
  are inferred from font size). It inherits chunking, metadata, fingerprint, and embed.
  See [research/pdf-extraction-engine.md](research/pdf-extraction-engine.md).
- **`code`** — overrides `Claims` (code extensions, minus minified/generated files), `Parse`
  (normalize + guard), and `Chunk` (a Chroma lexer finds definition boundaries by token
  category — pure Go, no CGO — one section per function/class, titled with its nesting path).
  See [chunking.md](chunking.md).
- **`docx`** — overrides `Claims` (`.docx`) and `Parse` (unzips the document with the standard
  library — no CGO — and maps Word heading paragraphs onto the heading-path model via
  `outlineLvl`). It inherits chunking, metadata, fingerprint, and embed. See
  [chunking.md](chunking.md).

Markdown, PDF, Code, and DOCX **embed** `GeneralStrategy` (Go composition, not inheritance), reusing its
methods without proxy code and overriding only what their format needs. The embedder is
injected, because embedding is a per-file operation the strategy owns. A `Pool` holds the
strategies; `Pool.For(path)` returns the first that claims a file.

## Pipelines — the flow between files

Two functions in `internal/pipeline`; they own iteration, database writes, and the status
decisions that advance or stop the flow.

- **Index** — walk the tree, ask the pool which strategy claims each file, register the
  claimed ones, then fingerprint the indexed documents to detect content changes.
- **Process** — for each scanned document, read the bytes and run `Parse → Chunk → Embed`;
  between those it reconciles chunks, writes vectors, and updates status.

Document status machine: `indexed → scanned → chunked → embedded`. Unchanged files are
short-circuited (fingerprint match) so they are never re-chunked or re-embedded.

## Storage

The resource entities (`Document`, `Chunk`, `ChunkEmbedding`, `FileMetadata`, status
constants) live in `core/storage` and depend on no database, so business logic can
reference the model without coupling to a store. Two backends implement the same interfaces,
and in both the document/chunk metadata and the vectors are **separate stores**:

- **Embedded** — `core/storage/sqlite` holds the `documents` and `chunks` tables (source of
  truth for chunk text); `core/storage/sqlitevec` holds the embeddings in a sqlite-vec `vec0`
  virtual table (`chunk_vectors`). Search is exact KNN over unit-normalized vectors (L2 ranks
  as cosine).
- **Server-side** — `core/storage/postgres` holds the same tables in PostgreSQL;
  `core/storage/pgvector` holds the embeddings in a pgvector table. Search is exact KNN by
  default, or approximate through an opt-in HNSW index.

Because metadata and vectors are separate stores (separate files in the embedded case),
grouping search hits into documents happens in Go, not as a SQL join. See
[research/sqlite-vec-migration.md](research/sqlite-vec-migration.md) and
[research/vector-search-scaling.md](research/vector-search-scaling.md).

## Embedding

Embedding is split into two injected parts: a **model** (`strategy.EmbeddingModel`) that owns the
model id, vector size, and prompt templates, and an **AI client** (`strategy.AiClient`) that
is the transport client speaking the OpenAI-compatible API. Keeping them separate lets the
same client serve any model. The default model is `EmbeddingGemma-300m-qat` (768-dim); its
`BuildData`/`BuildQuery` apply the templates documents and queries need — omitting them badly
degrades ranking.

## Search — query to documents

`Engine.Search` takes a `SearchConfig` and returns `DocumentResult`s, most relevant first, each
carrying the chunks that matched inside it. Chunks stay an internal detail — they are how a
document is embedded and matched, but the caller always gets documents. The flow lives in
`internal/pipeline`, behind the public `search.Searcher` seam so the whole algorithm is
replaceable (inject a `Searcher` through the engine config):

1. **Phrase and embed** the query with the model and AI client.
2. **Fetch** the top `maxSearchChunks` (4096, sqlite-vec's hard limit on KNN `k`) nearest chunk
   hits from the vector store. This is a fixed internal cap, not a caller knob: it bounds the work
   on very large indexes while staying cheap, because this stage carries only chunk ids and scores,
   no text.
3. **Map and filter** — a light `chunk_id → document_id` lookup (no text) resolves each hit to its
   document, and matches below `MinRelevance` are dropped.
4. **Group** the ranked chunks into documents; a document's score is its best (most relevant)
   chunk, and documents come out ordered by that score.
5. **Cap** to `MaxDocuments` documents and `MaxChunks` chunks each.
6. **Hydrate** only the survivors: load text and title for the kept chunks and each document's
   path. Deferring the text load to this final step is what keeps the earlier stages light, so a
   large fetch cap costs little.

Relevance is `1 - distance/2` (both backends use a cosine-equivalent metric with distance in
`[0, 2]`), so scores are 0–1 with higher meaning closer, matching how `MinRelevance` is set.
`SearchConfig` defaults: `MinRelevance` 0 (keep everything), `MaxDocuments` 20, `MaxChunks` 3.

## Build

cgo — both `mattn/go-sqlite3` and the sqlite-vec bindings compile from source, so a C
compiler is required (no prebuilt native libraries or install steps). PDF text extraction
uses PDFium compiled to WebAssembly and embedded in the binary via `go-pdfium`; it needs no
CGO and nothing installed. See
[research/pdf-extraction-engine.md](research/pdf-extraction-engine.md).
